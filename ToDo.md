# To Do

1. Redo sensitivity analysis using single demographic values, basically if you know what the demographic values are how much does the other stuff matter

2. Redo with Geocoris specific values. Estimating some of that stuff is gonna be really hard, but a main component is figuring out the time scale, so should def start here
